# passport-discord-faxes

Passport strategy for authentication with [Discord](http://discordapp.com) through the OAuth 2.0 API.

Before using this strategy, it is strongly recommended that you read through the official docs page [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2), especially about the scopes and understand how the auth works.

- Minor edits by [FAXES](https://faxes.zone). Created for OAuth in FAXES store items.


## Examples
An Express server example can be found in the `/example` directory. Be sure to `npm install` in that directory to get the dependencies.
